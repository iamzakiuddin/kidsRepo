  <h1>What is Behavior?</h1>

  <p>Behavior refers to how one conducts themselves. It is their actions, reactions, and functioning in response to everyday environments and situations. Challenging behavior is a term used to describe behavior that interferes with a child’s daily life. Managing children’s behavior is essential in maintaining order and structure in the lives of busy families, as well as setting children up for success.</p>

  <p>It is important to be aware that behavioral difficulties can often be indicative of difficulties/delays in other areas including: self-regulation, sensory processing, receptive and/or expressive language, executive functioning, social skills, and planning skills.</p>

  <p>Behavior includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Self-regulation:</strong> the ability to obtain, maintain, and change emotion, behavior, attention, and activity level appropriate for a task or situation.</li>
    <li><strong>Sensory processing:</strong> accurate processing of sensory stimulation in the environment as well as in one’s own body.</li>
    <li><strong>Executive Functioning:</strong> higher order reasoning and thinking skills</li>
    <li><strong>Emotional Development/regulation:</strong> involves the ability to perceive emotion, integrate emotion to facilitate thought, understand emotions, and to regulate emotions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why is Behavior Important?</h2>

  <p>Behavior is important for various reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Health and Quality of Life:</strong> Challenging behavior may seriously affect a child and parent/carers health and quality of life.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduce Risk:</strong> Some risks associated with challenging behavior include self-injurious behavior (including ingestion or inhalation of foreign bodies, hitting head on the floor or throwing body on the floor) can result in serious injuries. Accidental injury is also a common issue in children with aggressive behavior, not only for them but also the parents and carers involved.</li>
    <li><strong>Dietary Deficiencies:</strong> Oppositional behavior may result in dietary deficiencies, weight loss, or gross obesity.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Isolation:</strong> Challenging behavior can often lead to social isolation.</li>
    <li><strong>School Transition:</strong> Social isolation is likely to impact his sense of well-being and transition to school.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduce Mental Health Issues:</strong> Research also suggests that lack of social skills can lead to loneliness and depression from an early age.</li>
    <li><strong>Maturity:</strong> How a person behaves is a direct reflection of their maturity.</li>
  </ul>
