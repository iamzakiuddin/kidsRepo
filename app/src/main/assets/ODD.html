  <h1>Overview of Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)</h1>

  <p>Even the best-behaved children can be difficult and challenging at times. But oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) includes a frequent and ongoing pattern of anger, irritability, arguing, and defiance toward parents and other authority figures. ODD also includes being spiteful and seeking revenge, a behavior called vindictiveness.</p>

  <p>These emotional and behavioral issues cause serious problems with family life, social activities, school, and work. But as a parent, you don't have to try to manage a child with ODD alone. Your health care provider, a mental health professional, and a child development expert can help.</p>

  <p>Treatment of ODD involves learning skills to help build positive family interactions and to manage problem behaviors. Other therapy, and possibly medicines, may be needed to treat related mental health conditions.</p>

  <h2>Symptoms</h2>

  <p>Sometimes it's difficult to recognize the difference between a strong-willed or emotional child and one with oppositional defiant disorder. It's common for children to show oppositional behavior at certain stages of development.</p>

  <p>Symptoms of ODD generally begin during preschool years. Sometimes ODD may develop later, but almost always before the early teen years. Oppositional and defiant behaviors are frequent and ongoing. They cause severe problems with relationships, social activities, school, and work, for both the child and the family.</p>

  <h3>Emotional and Behavioral Symptoms of ODD</h3>
  <p>Generally last at least six months and include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Angry and irritable mood</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Often and easily loses temper.</li>
      <li>Is frequently touchy and easily annoyed by others.</li>
      <li>Is often angry and resentful.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Argumentative and defiant behavior</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Often argues with adults or people in authority.</li>
      <li>Often actively defies or refuses to follow adults' requests or rules.</li>
      <li>Often annoys or upsets people on purpose.</li>
      <li>Often blames others for their own mistakes or misbehavior.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Hurtful and revengeful behavior</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Says mean and hateful things when upset.</li>
      <li>Tries to hurt the feelings of others and seeks revenge, also called being vindictive.</li>
      <li>Has shown vindictive behavior at least twice in the past six months.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h3>Severity</h3>
  <p>ODD can be mild, moderate, or severe:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Mild. Symptoms occur only in one setting, such as only at home, school, work, or with peers.</li>
    <li>Moderate. Some symptoms occur in at least two settings.</li>
    <li>Severe. Some symptoms occur in three or more settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For some children, symptoms may first be seen only at home. But with time, problem behavior also may happen in other settings, such as school, social activities, and with friends.</p>

  <h2>When to see a doctor</h2>
  <p>Your child isn't likely to see their own behavior as a problem. Instead, your child will probably complain about unreasonable demands or blame others for problems.</p>

  <p>If you think your child may have ODD or other problem behavior, or you're concerned about your ability to parent a challenging child, seek help from a child psychologist or a child psychiatrist with expertise in behavior problems. Ask your child's pediatrician or other health care provider for a referral to a mental health provider.</p>
